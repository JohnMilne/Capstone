# Capstone

This is my Capstone project from my Data Science Immersion class at General Assembly.

I found a Kaggle dataset with parasitized and uninfected malarial cell images and trained a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize the parasitzed cell images.  I used a data generator to create sheers and rotations of the images for each training pass through the dataset for the neural network.

The resulting neural network trained to over 95% accuracy on testing data.
